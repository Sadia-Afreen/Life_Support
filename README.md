The project introduces an online based blood bank system which key features include the registration and sign in system of a donor, update-delete information, the status of a donor meaning if he is able or not able to give blood and if he is not then how many days left for him to be able to donate blood again. Also various search queries, donor information, request for blood are some of the key features. The project was made by following the ER, SCHEMA diagrams thoroughly. The project has a few limitations such as, donors cannot add their pictures. It can be improved by solving the limitations. Also, an android or an IOS based app of the project and financial statement of the donations can be done.
Although there are some drawbacks, we tried to create a system where both donors and patients searching for blood can get benefitted.
